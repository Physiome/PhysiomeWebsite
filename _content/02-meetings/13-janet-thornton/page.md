## Bioinformatics at EBI: Fulfilling the Work of Systems Biology

<img src="/assets/img/people/220x220/thornton-janet.jpg" alt="" class="portrait-left" />

The life sciences are now, more than ever, a big data science. Life sciences are firmly embedded as an "eScience". One of the major bottlenecks in systems biology is the handling, management and interoperability of data. I will introduce EBI - and describe how we are approaching some of these challenges.
