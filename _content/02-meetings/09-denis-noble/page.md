It is becoming clear that variation in organisms can be created by many different processes, including the gradual mutation idea of the Modern Synthesis, but also including larger changes through natural genome engineering, various forms of inheritance of acquired characteristics, symbiogenesis, genetic assimilation. Indeed, evolution itself must have evolved. The question how these mechanisms relate to each other is a fascinating new area for systems biology.
