## Towards a Predictive Systems-Level Model of the Human Microbiome

<img src="/assets/img/people/220x220/borenstein-elhanan.jpg" alt="" class="portrait-left" />

The human microbiome represents a vastly complex ecosystem that is tightly linked to many host-related processes and that directly impact human health. 

To date, however, most studies have focused on characterizing the composition of the microbiome in health and in disease and on comparative analyses, and relatively little effort has been directed at studying and modelling the microbiome as an integrated and comprehensive biological system. 

In this talk, I will highlight the pressing need for the development of predictive system-level models of the microbiome and discuss potential computational frameworks for metagenomic-based modelling of this microbial system. 

I will describe several preliminary attempts at constructing such models at the cellular, ecological and supra-organismal levels, accounting for the complex web of interactions in the microbiome. I will further review routes for integrating various modelling approaches and for obtaining a multi-scale modelling framework.

Finally, I will discuss exciting future clinical and ecological applications and research avenues facilitated by such models of the microbiome, including designer microbiomes and ecosystomics.

#### About Elhanan Borenstein

Elhanan Borenstein is an assistant professor of Genome Sciences at the University of Washington, with an adjunct position in the Department of Computer Science and engineering and an external professor position at the Santa Fe Institute for complexity science. 

He received his PhD in computer science from Tel-Aviv University, Israel, and held a joint postdoctoral fellowship at the Department of Biology in Stanford and at the Santa Fe Institute. 

Dr Borenstein uses computational and mathematical models, complex network analysis, and a systems biology approach to address a diverse set of central questions in evolutionary and systems biology. 

He studies the metabolic networks of microbes and microbiomes to identify the environmental and genetic factors that determine their organisation, function, and evolution. Applying these methods to study the human microbiome, he aims to develop a better systems-level predictive understanding of the microbiome and its role in human health.

Dr Borenstein is the recipient of various awards including, most recently, the Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship and the 2012 NIH New Innovator Award.
