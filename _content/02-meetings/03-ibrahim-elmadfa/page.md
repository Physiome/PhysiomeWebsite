## The role of antioxidants in the immune function

<img src="/assets/img/people/220x220/emladfa-ibrahim.jpg" alt="" class="portrait-left" />

Antioxidants are essential to the body’s function to cope with the constant burden of highly reactive molecules and free radicals arising from exogenous as well as endogenous sources.

However, while reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) can be detrimental to body structures like fatty acids and proteins and impair their functions, they are also part of physiological processes. Most importantly, they are used to kill pathogens during the respiratory burst. Damage to the radical-generating immune cells is prevented by antioxidants that are needed in adequate amounts to enable efficient defence.

Radicals are also involved in the synthesis of eicosanoids, important regulators of immune responses especially of the inflammatory kind. Moreover, ROS and nitric oxide (NO) play a role in cell signal transduction. As inducers of transcription factors like NFkB or AP-1, they regulate the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines.

An imbalance in the oxidative system, known as oxidative stress, disrupts these processes making a tight control of oxidative balance necessary for optimal immune function. Indeed, many non-communicable diseases linked to oxidative stress are characterised by chronic low-grade inflammation.

Considering the involvement of free radicals in the generation and progression of inflammatory processes, antioxidants can be used in the therapy as modulators of the immune answer. There is good evidence of the beneficial effects of nutritional antioxidants such as vitamins C and E and secondary plant compounds on diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.

A good status of antioxidants down-regulating inflammatory processes can also contribute to longevity and better health in later life.

However, due to the complex interactions between single antioxidants and their involvement in various processes, supplementation particularly with high doses requires great care. Especially in healthy persons, a well-balanced diet rich in vegetables, fruits and whole grain cereals is the best source of antioxidants.
