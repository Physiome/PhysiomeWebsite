## Multiscale regulatory networks in the mammalian brain: integrating genes and physiology

<img src="http://db.tt/Vi5Z6shP" alt="" class="portrait-left" />

Brainstem circuits play a key role in the maintenance of autonomic homeostasis. Maladaptation of these control 
systems underlies development and progression of chronic diseases such as hypertension. Understanding the network 
processes driving adaptation, plasticity, variability and robustness of these control circuits is important in 
developing targeted and personalized therapeutics. 

We have focused on unraveling and integrating the brainstem regulatory networks at multiple scales including 
cell-cell interactions and intracellular processes spanning signaling, transcriptional and post-transcriptional 
regulation, and electrophysiology. In probing these functional networks, we need to be able to assay and manipulate 
molecular processes occurring in individual cells on a very large scale of sample numbers and types, in their 
tissue and phenotypical context, to support network reconstruction. These requirements/approaches are uncommon 
in present mammalian systems biology practice and require synthesis of novel technical approaches into a coherent 
resource.

I will outline our strategy and present the results from our recent high-throughput experiments and computational 
modeling as first steps in reaching this goal. Importantly, our analysis thus far revealed a dynamic landscape of 
cell phenotypes and several network processes underpinning the robustness/plasticity of function in the brainstem.
