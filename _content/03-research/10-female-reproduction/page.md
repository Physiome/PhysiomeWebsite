title: Female reproductive system
---
The female reproductive system consists of the paired ovaries and oviducts, the uterus, vagina, (collectively, the ovaries and duct system are known as the internal genitalia, positioned within the pelvic cavity), external genitalia, and paired mammary glands.

The female reproductive system functions to synthesise the female gametes, ova; produce the sex hormones oestrogens and progesterone; and provide a protective environment in which the embryo develops until birth.

At the Bioengineering Institute, The University of Auckland, a Breast Modelling group has recently been formed. In collaboration with scientists from the University of Oxford, the University of Canterbury, and from Mirada Solutions Ltd., the group hope to model breast deformation during various imaging modalities (X-ray, MRI, CT). The ultimate aim is that this project will play a role in facilitating cancer detection.
