title: Integumentary system
---
Together with its derivatives such as sweat and oil glands, nails and hair the skin make up a complex set of organs that form the integumentary system. The integumentary system performs a number of different functions, including:

- Protection against chemical, physical and biological damage;
- Helping to maintain a constant body temperature;
- Detection of stimuli in the external environment;
- Synthesis of important biological compounds such as vitamin D and collagenase;
- Providing a significant blood reservoir, stored within the dermal vasculature;
- Excretion of excess water, salt and nitrogenous metabolic wastes through the process of sweating.

### Global modelling initiatives

Globally, several different skin modelling initiatives exist. Some of the characteristics of skin that scientists are trying to capture in mathematical models include: the mechanical and elastic properties of skin as a soft tissue; skin pigmentation; and wound healing and scar tissue formation. The latter topic is being studied by:

- [Professor Philip Maini at the Mathematical Institute, Oxford](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/maini/), with potential applications such as modelling wound contraction, fibroproliferative diseases, scar tissue formation and corneal wound healing
- [Professor James Murray at Washington University](http://depts.washington.edu/amath/people/faculty/murray/), is also modelling wound healing, with a view to understanding and preventing severe scarring. Professor Murray is also interested in modelling fingerprint formation. Professor Murray's Homepage
- [Professor Jonathan Sherratt at Heriot-Watt University](http://www.ma.hw.ac.uk/~jas/) is also modelling scar tissue formation
