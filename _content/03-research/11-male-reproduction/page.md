title: Male reproductive system
---
The male reproductive system is composed of the testes, genital ducts, accessory genital glands, and the external genitalia: the penis and the scrotum. The primary role of the male reproduction system is to produce the male gamete (sperm), the sex hormone testosterone, and seminal fluid, a nutrient rich fluid that transports and nourishes the sperm as they pass through the genital ducts.
