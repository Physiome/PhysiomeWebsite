#### Broader browser support

New Zinc plugin has been released and now supports both Firefox, Chrome and Safari with full support and partially on Opera.

#### Incompatibility with scripts written for Zinc 0.6.4.4 or earlier

Zinc 0.7.0.0 and above will not be compatible with scripts written for Zinc 0.6.4.4 or earlier, however the changes required to get the old scripts going on Zinc 0.7.0.0 should be straight forward.

#### Running examples using Zinc 0.7.0.0

You can run the examples using Zinc 0.7.0.0 through Firefox or Google Chrome and the HTML itself should give a brief preview of what the function calls will be like when the full version comes out. A quick-reference page will also be available soon.
