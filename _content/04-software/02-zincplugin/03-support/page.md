### About the Zinc plugin

The Zinc plugin is an extension that embeds the [cmgui](/software/cmgui) visualisation engine into your browser. 

The Zinc plugin has been completely re-written as an NPruntime plugin, replacing the old Firefox extension. This plugin works in a range of browsers (Firefox, Opera, Google Chrome, Safari) and on a range of operating systems. This re-write will also move the plugin more in line with current best practices for plugin development.
