### Overview

Cmgui is a generic open-source modelling and visualisation package developed at the ABI with significant external contributions from industry. It is commonly used to enable researchers to visualise biomedical images alongside the dynamic geometry fields from computer models of cells, tissues and organs. Cmgui is coded in C/C++ and consists of data structures for describing hierarchical models built from mathematical fields.

### Visualising data

Cmgui also contains graphics conversion operations for making field visualisations, and tools for interactively manipulating models. Dr Richard Christie leads the development of cmgui alongside Alan Wu, and with an external collaboration with Shane Blackett and Carey Stevens at Spark Dental Technology Ltd.

### The Zinc plugin

A major part of the cmgui project has been the development of a unique web browser extension or plug-in called ZINC for viewing and interacting with cmgui scenes on the web. While cmgui began as a standalone programme, the focus is now on further developing the cmgui library for independent software developers wishing to describe their models and visualise graphics.
