Cmgui is an advanced 3D visualisation software package. It provides a mathematical modelling environment initially developed by the Auckland Bioengineering Institute at The University of Auckland.

### Functionality

Some of the main areas of functionality of Cmgui are as follows:

- 3D visualisation of finite element and boundary element meshes
- mesh creation
- mathematical field visualisation and manipulation

### Command line driven

Cmgui is a command line driven program. Usually script files are read or commands are typed in the cmgui command window to read in your mesh, create a 3D visualisation and manipulate it. Many tasks can also be accomplished by using the mouse to select options from various menus and dialogs.

### Supported by detailed documentation

Cmgui has a large amount of functionality but it can be challenging for a new user to figure out what command to use to accomplish exactly what they want to do. Fortunately there are a large number of examples demonstrating the use of various different commands.

### Examples gallery

A gallery demonstrating some of the uses of Cmgui is available on the [CMISS site](http://cmiss.bioeng.auckland.ac.nz/development/examples/a/index_thumbs.html).
