title: FieldML API
---
FieldML is developed as a data model and accompanying API. Serialisation of FieldML will be via an XML file format, as well as other possible formats.

Initially, FieldML support is being developed for two key open source projects:

- [cmgui](/software/cmgui/) - visualisation application
- [OpenCMISS](/software/opencmiss/) - large scale computational software

These two projects both have precursors to the FieldML data model and API, and as such serve to guide the design of FieldML.
