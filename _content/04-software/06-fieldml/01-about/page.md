###Overview

FieldML is a declarative language for representing hierarchical models using generalized mathematical fields. FieldML can be used to represent the dynamic 3D geometry and solution fields from computational models of cells, tissues and organs. It enables model interchange for the bioengineering and general engineering analysis communities.

Example uses are models of tissue structure, the distribution of proteins and other biochemical compounds, anatomical annotation, and other biological annotation.
