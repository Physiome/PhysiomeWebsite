### Overview

CM is the computational back end of CMISS, which is a suite of software for Continuum Mechanics, Image analysis, Signal processing and System identification.

CM has a development history of more than thirty years, and over that time has become a powerful and versatile piece of software for modelling complex biological systems.

In order to fully utilize the power of CM on modern highly parallel supercomputing platforms, CM is being re-written from the ground up as the OpenCMISS project.
