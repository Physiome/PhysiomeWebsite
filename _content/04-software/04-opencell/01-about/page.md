### Overview

OpenCell is a Free / Open Source environment for working with CellML. The project was started at the Auckland Bioengineering Institute at The University of Auckland, and grew to include developers from around the world.

It provides a unified way to work with CellML documents, including creating new models, editing existing models, and running simulations.

### Explore CellML models

OpenCell is useful for exploring the CellML models in the CellML model repository, as most of these models have OpenCell sessions - clickable interfaces for exploring the models via a diagram of the model structure.

### OpenCOR

Development of OpenCell has been stopped, in favour of work on its replacement OpenCOR.
