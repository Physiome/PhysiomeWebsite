###Overview

The Zinc library is intended to provide the advanced visualisation capabilites of Cmgui in the form of a library on which to build new applications.

###The Zinc library API

All of the functions of Cmgui are now available via the Zinc library API. This will allow researchers and students to build their own applications to perform their modelling and visualisation tasks without having to rely on scripts for Cmgui.
