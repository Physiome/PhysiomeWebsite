#### Installation

1. Download either the above installer (preferred) or zip archive.

2. For the installer, run the exe; an install wizard will pop up, follow the steps and select 'Add OpenCMISS-Zinc to the system PATH for all users' (or add it manually for a single user as described below). For the zip archive, extract the contents of the archive where you want Zinc installed, and add its top folder to the PATH environment variable for the current user (In Windows 7 this is under Control Panel|User Accounts|Change my environment variables).

3. Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable is also required for 64-bit Windows. It can be downloaded and installed from the following [Microsoft page](http://search.microsoft.com/en-us/DownloadResults.aspx?q=Microsoft+Visual+C%2b%2b+2010+SP1+Redistributable+Package).
