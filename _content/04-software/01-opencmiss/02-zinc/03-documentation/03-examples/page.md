A good way to learn Zinc is to copy examples that perform a similar task to what is needed. Most of the examples here use the same [Mozilla Public License v2.0](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/) as the Zinc codebase.

Several examples using Zinc from Python with a Qt user interface are downloadable from the [SVN repository](https://svn.physiomeproject.org/svn/cmiss/zinc/bindings/examples/trunk/python/).

Most of the [Cmgui examples](http://cmiss.bioeng.auckland.ac.nz/development/examples/a/index_thumbs.html) can be translated into Zinc code (not all since there are a few features in Cmgui which are not exposed in, or part of the Zinc Library). With few exceptions the object names in Cmgui are the same as in Zinc.
