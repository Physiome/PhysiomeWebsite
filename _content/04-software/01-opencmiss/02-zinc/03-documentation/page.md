<p>The best way to learn Zinc is to work through examples that achieve a similar objective to what you need. The tutorials are designed to get you started and provide detailed explanations of concepts and how Zinc works. At any stage users can get an overview of the library and its concepts from the introduction in the API reference, and look up the detailed descriptions of API methods in that section.
