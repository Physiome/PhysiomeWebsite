If you cannot find the information you need from the [Zinc Documentation](../documentation), or you encounter bugs or you wish to request new features, please use the following links.

### Mailing List

We are establishing a mailing list for users of OpenCMISS software to be the first place to request help from the OpenCMISS user and development community. Until this is set up please use one of the following avenues for support.

### Tracker

The Zinc Library section of the [Physiome Project Tracker](https://tracker.physiomeproject.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&product=Zinc%20library) is where we track bugs, new features, design ideas and occasionally user queries. We only ever add code changes for items in the tracker. Users can post their own items on the tracker, or developers may create them in response to your queries.

We encourage users to post their own items on the tracker, which requires only to create an account. *Please try to search for your issue* in the tracker before posting. If you find a tracker item that matches your problem or feature, please indicate your interest on the item (in a post, and/or add yourself to the CC list) so we can prioritise it accordingly.

### Contact the Developers
 
If you cannot find the information you require from the documentation, tracker and other Zinc users, please contact the developers at the Auckland Bioengineering Institute:
