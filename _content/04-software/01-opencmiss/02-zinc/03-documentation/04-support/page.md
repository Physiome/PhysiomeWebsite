If you cannot find the information you need from the [Zinc Documentation](../documentation), or you encounter bugs or you wish to request new features, please use the following links.

### Mailing Lists

For user support please e-mail the 'users' list (with 'Zinc' in the subject line) described in:

[OpenCMISS Mailing Lists](/software/opencmiss/mailinglists)

### Tracker

The [Zinc Library tracker section](https://tracker.physiomeproject.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&product=Zinc%20library) is where we track bugs, new features, design ideas and occasionally user queries. We only ever add code changes for items in the tracker.

Typically we ask users to first send issues and feature requests to the Users mailing list (see above) from which the developers will raise tracker items. However, feel free to search the tracker for issues and features that might be relevant to you. By creating an account on the tracker you can add your feedback to an existing issue. We stongly encourage users to add their interest in getting a feature or bug fix completed by posting to and CCing to the item: this helps us to increase the priority with which they are looked into.

### Contact the Developers
