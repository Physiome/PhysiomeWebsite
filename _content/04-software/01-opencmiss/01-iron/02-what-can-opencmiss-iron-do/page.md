###Large deformation solid mechanics and 3D fluid mechanics

Currently in OpenCMISS-Iron large deformation solid mechanics and 3D fluid mechanics (Navier-Stokes and Darcy) have been implemented to enable detailed analysis of pump function of the heart, and analysis of the supply of coronary blood flow.

Most recently this functionality has been complemented with the addition of surface coupling of solid mechanics to the fluid mechanics allowing multi-physics simulations to be performed.

###Reaction diffusion solvers

This functionality has been further complemented with the introduction of reaction diffusion solvers to simulate electrical activation in the form of monodomain physics. The introduction of these functionalities further increases the biophysical detail and the scientific application of large-scale multi-physics simulations.
