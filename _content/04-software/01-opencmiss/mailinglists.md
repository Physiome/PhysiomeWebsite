###OpenCMISS Mailing Lists

#### Users

User issues and questions about any OpenCMISS software can be e-mailed to the following mailing list address for developers and other users to respond to:

<users@opencmiss.org>

Please help us by using a descriptive message subject which summarises the issue or question, and also states the software component (Iron, Zinc, Cmgui etc.) and operating system, if the issue is specific to one.

When the [archive](https://list.opencmiss.org/sympa/arc/users) is more established we ask you to first look for your issue there.

We invite anyone to subscribe to the OpenCMISS users mailing list by clicking on 'Subscribe' at [this link](https://list.opencmiss.org/sympa/info/users). Once subscribed you will receive any future questions from users and announcements from the developers, and can respond to them as part of the OpenCMISS community.

#### Developers

If you intend to extend or contribute to the OpenCMISS codebase, you can subscribe to the OpenCMISS Developers mailing list at [this link](https://list.opencmiss.org/sympa/info/developers). Once subscribed you will receive future developer notifications and exchanges and be able to take part by mailing the developer list at <developers@opencmiss.org>.
