If you cannot find the information you need from the [Cmgui Documentation](documentation), or if you encounter bugs or you wish to request new features, please use the following links.

### Tracker

The [Cmgui tracker section](https://tracker.physiomeproject.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&product=cmgui) is where we track bugs, new features, design ideas and occasionally user queries. We only ever add code changes for items in the tracker. Users can post their own items on the tracker, or developers may create them in response to your queries. The [OpenCMISS-Zinc tracker section](https://tracker.physiomeproject.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&product=Zinc%20library) may also have issues relevant to Cmgui.

We encourage users to post their own items on the tracker, which requires only to create an account. *Please try to search for your issue* in the tracker before posting. If you find a tracker item that matches your problem or feature, please indicate your interest on the item (in a post, and/or add yourself to the CC list) so we can prioritise it accordingly.
