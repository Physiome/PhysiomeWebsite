### Get the executable

Cmgui is currently available for download for a wide variety of platforms. You can download the appropriate executable for your operating system from our download page.

### Extracting the archive

Cmgui is quite a large application so the executable has been archived (tarred) and compressed (zipped) to make it faster to download. Once you have downloaded the executable all you need to do is untar and unzip it and it is ready to run. On Linux you can untar and unzip the tar.gz file with the command tar -xf filename.tar.gz. On Windows you will need winzip or something similar to unzip the file.

### Run Cmgui

You should now be able to run Cmgui by either clicking on the executable or by changing into the directory it is located in and then typing ./ followed by the name of the executable at the command prompt, eg ./cmgui-wx. This will bring up the Cmgui command window interface.

### Tips

#### For Linux users

For convenience it is a good idea to place the directory containing cmgui into your PATH environmental variable. That way you will be able to run cmgui without having to be in the directory that contains the executable. To do this on a linux system you can specify your PATH variable in your .profile file.

#### For Windows users

On windows you can edit your PATH variable by right clicking on my computer and then selecting: properties, advanced, environment variables. Ask your local system administrator if you do not know how to edit the PATH variable for your operating system.
