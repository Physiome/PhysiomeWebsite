   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.


The PyZinc tutorials are arranged so that you can get know the Zinc library on a number of different levels.  First and foremost are the installation and 
getting started documents.  Once you have installed Zinc and have seen it working you can move on to the interaction tutorials.  The interaction tutorials
are split into three levels with the first level on understanding how the Zinc library can respond to user events.  The second level covers a particular feature
or module of the Zinc library and utilises the helper ZincWidget class and the third level is based around zlab a collection of high level classes and functions
that can quickly produce visualisations in Zinc.

Introduction
------------
These examples cover the installation and a first look at using Zinc that are non-graphical 
that may for instances be used for batch processing purposes.
