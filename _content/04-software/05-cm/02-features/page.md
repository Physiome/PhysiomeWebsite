### Overview

CM is an advanced computational engine for solving bioengineering and physiological modelling problems. It provides a general modelling environment for finite element, boundary element, and finite difference techniques.

Commands may be given to cm via command files, or a simple text-based user interface. CM also has some very basic capabilities for displaying geometry graphically, as well as entering data using a mouse. CM can be run remotely on high performance computers.

### Problem types

CM has a very broad range of capabilities, and can solve the following classes of problem:

- Classical field
- Elasticity
- Bioelectrics
- Fluid mechanics
- Electromagnetics
- Fitting
- Optimisation

Within each problem class there are a large number of supported equation types. Take a look at the examples to get more information on the kinds of tasks CM can perform.
