OpenCMISS is an object based, modular, extendible, portable, open-source, publicly available code. It has been developed as a library of routines with bindings for Fortran and C. OpenCMISS-cm is the computational back-end component, written in Fortran95, with distributed memory parallelisation, enabling the code to be run both in serial and parallel. cmgui is used as the graphical front-end.
