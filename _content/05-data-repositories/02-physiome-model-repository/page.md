title: Physiome Model Repository
---
The main goal of the Physiome Model Repository is to provide a resource for the community to store, retrieve, search, reference, and reuse CellML models.

A publicly accessible repository of published models is now available. This site contains over 200 examples of models expressed as CellML files, together with associated metadata, citations, and figures.

</ul>

The Physiome Model Repository also provides a context for the models within the larger biological domain of data repositories. Examples of repositories, or interfaces to such repositories, are BioPax, Tambis, BioCyc, Gene Ontology NG, Physiome, aMaze, PSI, MGED, PEDRo, and Digital Anatomist.

We are keen to link the Physiome programme into these efforts by developing interfaces and applications that enable information in such sites to be associated with our own model representations and development.
